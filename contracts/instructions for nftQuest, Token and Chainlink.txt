How everything works:

You should probably try it in remix first

1. Compile RPGToken, then input initial supply before u deploy it.

2. Compile nftQuest, input will be the address of RPGToken, then deploy it.

3. In account 1, use RPGToken to issue max initial supply

4. From account 1, transfer the tokens to nftQuest address

5. From there you can test out mint, start fight and watch the levels increase

For Chainlink integration, if you can get it integrated through VRFv2Consumer.sol

Roughly how chainlink works:

1. Don't keep running the requests because it costs quite a lot of link tokens that we can't get easily

2. Use injected provider - metamask, make sure u have eth on sepolia eth test net on your metamask

3. use subscription id 660 before u click deploy

4. request random function will request 2 random numbers 

5. once requests are completed, use getRequestStatus to get the array of 2 numbers

If you got any questions you can feel free to ask me :)
